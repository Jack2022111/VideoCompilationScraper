# VideoCompilationScraper
A project designed to make it easier for creators to access new content

VideoLoader.py is the main class that you should start when running the projecct
videocompiler.py is the class that edits the downloaded videos into a compilation file named output.mp4
videouploader.py is the class that uploads the output file to youtube
the index.html file is necessary in allowing the button to function after the code starts

make sure the python files are all in the same directory
you should customize the code output of the videoloader function to your desired files inthe directory

Thank you
